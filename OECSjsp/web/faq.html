<p><b>What is a MLM?</b></p>
<p>MLM (multi-level marketing) is a retail distribution channel form including a manufacturer and a set of registered independent distributors who together distribute the manufacturers products directly to the market. MLM is therefore a type of direct selling.</p>

<p><b>What motivates a person to become an MLM distributor? </b></p>
<p>The ability to personally consume preferred products at a wholesale price rather than pay retail prices; The desire to share the benefits of the MLM?s products with others; Short-term goal seeking (like making money for holiday gifts) motivates a person to become a MLM Distributor. </p>

<p><b>How does an MLM distributor earn income? </b></p>
<p>There are two major sources of MLM income. First, the distributor earns the difference between the retail price s/he charges and the wholesale price s/he paid to acquire product. Second, a business-builder can earn commissions on the sales of distributors downline from him/her. Beyond this, the distributor financially benefits from personal consumption at wholesale prices, because s/he otherwise would pay some retail markup to acquire these products for personal use. </p>

<p><b>What is the difference between direct selling, network marketing, and multi-level marketing? </b></p>
<p>Direct selling and network marketing refer to the distribution system, while the term "multi-level marketing" describes the compensation plan. </p>
<p><b>What is the purpose of this site? </b></p>
<p>To offer a representative list of MLMs and compare them based on public interest. </p>
<p><b>How is public interest determined? </b></p>
<p>By search queries done on the major search engines every thirty day period. </p>



<p><b>Do I need qualifications or a sales background? </b></p>
<p>No, we provide you with all the training and guidance you will need to become successful within our team.  Remember, I knew nothing of this industry back in 2002 but I have been in the TOP 1% highest earners for the past 5 years.  You will receive one on one expert guidance and exclusive training materials to help you build a successful MLM business. </p>
<p><b>What are the advantages of joining the MLM industry over working a full-time job? </b></p>
<p>The advantages of becoming an MLM Leader over working a 9-5 job are simple.  You become your own boss and you choose who what when and how you work your business.  All your efforts are seen in your results every 3 weeks.  The only thing you need to build this business is time!  Money isn't necessarily a need in the early days, just your time, dedication and passion to build your own residual income.  The residual/passive income is the most attractive part of MLM.  You may take "time off" but you will still get paid. </p>
<p><b>Can I belong to more than one company? </b></p>
<p>Most network marketing companies will allow you to belong to more than one company. However, most companies do restrict their distributors' activities in promoting other companies' opportunities and products. The most common policy allows distributors to introduce other opportunities only to individuals that they have already personally sponsored. In addition, most companies won't let their distributors promote other opportunities or products at any company-sponsored events or activities. </p>
<p><b>Can my husband and I have two distributorships? </b></p>
<p> Actually this is not a legal issue. This is a policy adopted by companies who are concerned that distributors will "stack" and manipulate to achieve better payout in the compensation plan. Although many companies permit more than one distributorship in a household, the majority do not. </p>
